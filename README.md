# Native-bees

The custom dataset aims to monitor automatically of native bee hives using non-invasive techniques. It consists of videos of the entry of several beehives for Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) identified as XXXY-Y, where XXX identifies the hive location and Y-Y the recording interval. Each video contains an information file with metadata.
